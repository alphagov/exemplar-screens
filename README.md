You can view different sets of screenshots for each exemplar, zoom in and out of them or step through them in order.


## Running this app locally

The app is very simple and doesn't require anything to be installed or run in a terminal. Just open the index.html file in the root folder. It works especially well in Chrome's presentation mode. Your mileage may vary in other browsers.


## How to contribute

If you work on one of the exemplars and want to add or update screenshots of it please go ahead, you'd be doing us all a big favour. Pull requests are the best way. You'll need to know how to use Git and how to edit very simple data files.
 

### 1. Add your images

Each exemplar has it's own numbered folder in '/exemplar'. Drop all your images into the 'images' subfolder (1024px wide is best).

### 2. Update the data file

Edit the data.js file in your numbered exemplar folder. It contains a few examples so you can see how the data should be structured.

### 3. Update the index file

Once you're done, don't forget to add a link to your exemplar from the 'index.html' file in the root of this repository (not the one in your numberd exemplar folder).
